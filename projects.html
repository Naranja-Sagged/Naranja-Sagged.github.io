                        Giga cool and slammin game programmed in the online multiplayer game, Rust, not to be confused with the programming language Rust.

                        OSU, the online rhythm game genetically engineered by Dean Herbert (Yes, he is the dean of osu!(Ohio State University)).
                        I've been working on this project on/off since 2013, putting about 1086+ hours into it.

                        Very Epic and Cool. You wouldn't want to fuck with this one IRL. OSU storyboard (eBook with accompanying rotoscoped Japanese-style animation) Look it up online it is not named after the plumbing appliance for No reason.

                    <p>
                        The goal of the game is to die. Planned to release some time after OSU Lazer comes out. Named CJ Game of Life on my resume for obvious reasons.
