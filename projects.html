                        OSU, the online rhythm game genetically engineered by Dean Herbert (Yes, he is the dean of osu!(Ohio State University)).
                        I've been working on this project on/off since 2013, putting about 1086+ hours into it.

                        Very Epic and Cool. You wouldn't want to fuck with this one IRL. OSU storyboard (eBook with accompanying rotoscoped Japanese-style animation) Look it up online it is not named after the plumbing appliance for No reason.

                        The goal of the game is to die. Planned to release some time after OSU Lazer comes out. Named CJ Game of Life on my resume for obvious reasons.

                    <p>
                        Very highly functional osu! Cheat detection system. Runs an osu! replay file through FireDigger's replay parser (Yes I got the Man, Alexandr Makarov's permission) and analyzes the information to bust those dirty cheaters clicking circles illegally. 
                        Ever wonder if your friend who beat your score that one time was cheating? Yes, he was definitely cheating. Run it through our (Naranja Sagged's + MyAngelNeptune's) OSU Replay Analyzer to get 100% accurate evidence that your friend was cheating in osu! and is a scumbag deranker.

                        This online IRC-powered Application written in Java scripts (No it was actually written in Python, but it does contain some JavaScript (not to be confused with scripts written in Java, which is What I was talking about))
